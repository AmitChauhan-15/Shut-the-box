          The object of the game SHUT THE BOX is to shut all boxes or obtain the
          lowest score.
        </li>
        <li>
          During each round, each player will take turns which consists of
          multiple rolls to close as many boxes as possible (by clicking the
          number box to close certain number). The player can choose up to any
          combination or pattern in which they feel but maximum 3 box per roll.
          The first player rolls both dice and counts the number of &r
          &lsquo;pips&rsquo; (black dots) on the dice. Add the numbers on the
          dice together. Using this total, the player can knock down or
          &lsquo;close&rsquo; any combination of numbered box that add up to the
          total. For example, if a player rolls a total 9, the player can choose
          up to any of the following:<br />

          9 || 8,1 || 6,3 || 5,4 || 4,2 & 3 || 4,1 & 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player continues to roll the dice until they can no longer
          &lsquo;close&rsquo; an appropriate combination of numbers. If none of
          the options are available to play and have been covered, then the
          players turn is finished. Add up the numbers on the box that remain
          &lsquo;open&rsquo;, and this is the first player&rsquo;s score. For
          example, if the 1, 2, and 9 box are still &lsquo;open&rsquo;, the
          player&rsquo;s score is 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          When it is the second player&rsquo;s turn, all the boxes are opened
          again, and the second player repeats the process of the game. The
          round will continue untill at the end of round any one player score 45
          or more, then the other player wins the game. If both player score
          more then 45 at the end of the round then the player with lowest score
          win.

          Shut The Box is a simple dice game that requires more than sheer luck
          with the throw of dice to win. The total value of the number of pips
          on the dice corresponds to the total value of tiles a player can drop,
          which brings in the element of arithmetic thinking and strategy to win
          the game. With each tile, you drop, you inch closer to shutting the
          box.<br /><br />
          Although the history of Shut The Box lacks conclusive evidence,
          tell-tales confirm it dates back to as long as the 12th century and
          finds origins in France. Some theories also suggest that it was born
          in the bars during the mid 20th century and the pubs of 1960s
          Manchester are living proof of the same.<br /><br />
